My fifth-grade teacher required us to write in a journal during class. She would
often supply a topic that we would write about. My entries in the fall of 1978
indicated a bit of an obsession:

- If I had three wishes: Wish number 1: The Millennium Falcon
- Happiest moment: Seeing *Star Wars* for the first time
- Best Movie I Ever Saw: *STAR WARS* (had seen it 10 times at that point)
- Favorite Car: Corvette from *Corvette Summer* (that starred Mark Hamill)
- Favorite Books: *Fight in the Mountains* and *Star Wars* (which I claimed to
  have read almost 5 times)
- My Favorite Hero: Luke Skywalker is my hero (followed by much of the blurb
  from the back of the novel)
- TV Shows: *Battlestar Galactica* and *Mork and Mindy*
- My Hobbies: Among a couple of other things, *Star Wars* (the movie, the book,
  as well as *Splinter of the Mind's Eye*, a follow-up *Star Wars* novel)

It is inconceivable that there was a *Star Wars* TV show airing November 17th
that year and I didn't watch it. But my journal doesn't mention it. These could
be fake memories, but I think I talked it up to my family (since there was one
TV and 7 people with potential opinions about what to watch) and later felt like
I might have over-sold it.

Even though my *Star Wars* obsession faded away with my childhood, Steve Kozak's
book about the Holiday Special was super-interesting to me for the things I
learned. Referring to my list above, I didn't realize that Alan Dean Foster, who
wrote *Splinter of the Mind's Eye* had ghost written the original *Star Wars*
novel attributed to George Lucas. I was also delighted to read that Robin
Williams had been considered for a role in the Holiday Special but was deemed
insufficiently famous since *Mork and Mindy* hadn't aired before the Holiday
Special's casting.

But the most eye opening part was the view into the film and television
production process and business, being totally new to me. Part of the motivation
for creating the Special was to keep up audience awareness in the years until
*The Empire Strikes Back* would come out -- with industry insiders suggesting to
Lucas that they'd otherwise soon forget all about *Star Wars* (Ha!). It was also
intended to sell toys, since a lot of Lucas' compensation for *Star Wars* was in
merchandising. There had been some successful TV spots involving the main *Star
Wars* cast members and dancing stormtroopers on the *Donny and Marie* show, so a
dedicated TV special seemed like a great idea.

Where it suffered was in vision and execution.

Lucas gave some of the former, but was too busy with other projects to carry it
through, and while some very talented people worked on the show, nobody seemed
completely within their comfort zone. You had song and dance variety show people
trying to do something with science fiction. You had a meticulous documentary
filmmaker trying to shoot for TV and blowing through budget before walking away
and leaving the rest of the taping to a director who had a couple of weeks
between projects to step in. Actors in heavy and constricting costumes were
passing out from heat exhaustion. Most people didn't know how what they were
doing would fit together. The final editing was overseen by the aforementioned
variety show people who had never edited before.

The results were not stellar. But, being TV, it was done with and people moved
on.

Kozak talks about how the Special became a semi-mythical entity after that. Some
people didn't believe that it even existed, some people that were in it *denied*
that it existed, but there were (low quality) recordings of the show
circulating. When YouTube eventually came along, those became accessible to
everyone. It was fun to take a pause from reading at times to watch the scenes
described in the book... in small doses.

While the book includes biting comments about the show's poor quality (and the
creators' apparent preferred drugs), I appreciate that Kozak wrapped up with
some positive sentiments. Being creative means taking risks. Sometimes those
risks pay off and other times they don't. It may seem trite, but we do in fact
learn from failure.

It reminded me of my own desire to not always be a passive consumer and to
actually make things. It is less risky to throw stones at things other people
have made, never putting yourself out there, but also less rewarding.

*Disclaimer*: The author lives down the street from me and gave me a copy of the
book and a dubious editing credit in thanks for helping when his
computer/printer/internet were misbehaving. To his chagrin, as often as not
things would start working again as soon as I walked into his office.
