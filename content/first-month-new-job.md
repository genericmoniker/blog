Congratulations on getting your new job as a software engineer! Your employer
and team are happy to have you join them. Here are some tips for the first few
weeks to help them feel like they made the right choice in hiring you. 

Work hours
----------

Learn what the work time expectations are for your job -- even before you start
if you can. The norm for a full work day is 8 hours. Usually that doesn't
include the time you break for lunch unless specifically stated. A lot of
people work longer than this -- because they enjoy their work or have
commitments to meet -- but a smart employer won't mandate long hours because
that is counter-productive.

When starting a new job, work at least as long as your teammates. If they work
10 hour days, you might not want to do that long-term, but certainly don't be
cutting out of work after 7 hours on your first day to beat traffic or
something. As you gain the trust of your team, working hours can be more
flexible and you can pattern your day for your own best productivity and
work-life balance.

Be Engaged
----------

It can take a little while to get integrated into the flow of tasks that need
to be done. If you don't have a specific assignment, you can at least make
yourself more valuable by learning about the software your team is building and
practicing with the technologies it uses. It isn't time to rejoice that you can
binge watch Netflix or catch up on PewDiePie.

If you're in a meeting be present. Unless you are using it for something
*directly* related, your phone stays in your pocket and your other devices are
set aside. At first, there will be a lot of things happening in meetings that
you don't understand. Rather than tuning out, figure out questions you can ask
(either during the meeting or later, as appropriate) that will help you ramp
up. Over time, if a meeting seems pointless, you can:

1. Discuss with your team if you really need to be there.
2. Propose that the purpose of the meeting be accomplished some other way.
3. Try to understand better how you can contribute or benefit from it.

Balance Being Stuck
-------------------

On a new job, the volume of things to learn can make your first assignments
seem daunting. You'll likely run up against something that roadblocks your
progress. Balance wrestling with the problem against being stuck for a long
time. You don't want to run to your teammates or mentor with every challenge,
but you also don't want to spend hours on something that could be resolved with
a little help. Have you Googled for a solution? Read any documentation there
might be? Clearly articulated the problem to yourself (or your rubber duck)?Experimented with some possibilities? If you're still stuck, get some
help.

Someone else may be better suited to do a task than you are, but don't be too
quick to give up and go looking for something else. If you can work through a
challenge, perhaps with someone's help, that will make you all the more capable
for future tasks.

Connect with Your Team
----------------------

If your coworkers invite you to lunch, go with them, even if you've got some
great left-over lasagna waiting in the fridge. You might not want to spend the
time or money going out a lot, or have other midday plans, but early on, take
advantage of chances to get to know your team.

Don't wear headphones the entire day. And probably not all during the first
month of a new job. After that, if you need to block out ambient noise, or
music helps you focus (and I mean for real, because multitasking is a myth)
then it is fine. Just don't hide behind them and cut yourself off.
