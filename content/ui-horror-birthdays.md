Last year I wrote about my [dislike for cell
phones]({filename}/them-newfangled-cellphone-things.md).
Despite that, I actually have one now. Maybe I'll write more about that at some
point, but I was just recently **reminded** (irony to be revealed later) of a
particularly sloppy user experience associated with adding birthdays to
contacts and I couldn't help rant a little.

<!--more-->

This is Windows Mobile I'm talking about (version 6), and the feature is
the ability to enter someone's birthday in their contact entry. When you
do this, it automatically adds an all-day event in the calendar
application. Ooh, cross-application interoperability!

There's only one problem: Newly added calendar items automatically get a
reminder 15 minutes before the start. When does someone's birthday
start? Midnight, of course. So, by entering a birthday,
you'reÂ inadvertently scheduling yourself opportunity to celebrate it at
11:45 PM the night before! Since I use my phone as my alarm clock, it's
right there on the nightstand so I'm sure not to miss it.

By the way, I hope you had a nice birthday, Todd.
