On December 3, 2008, Logitech (my employer)
[announced](http://blog.logitech.com/2008/12/03/one-billion-logitech-mice/)
that it had shipped its billionth mouse. While I didn't contribute much
to that as an employee (I work in a [non-mouse
division](http://www.wilife.com)), I have helped as a consumer: I think
I personally own four Logitech mice.

As part of the company internal celebration, there was a video contest
with fairly liberal rules: One minute in length or less, something to do
with mice.

Here is my prize-winning entry:
