By the time Christmas comes around, our house is usually awash with
boxes from Amazon. It gets a bit tricky at that point, because I'm never
sure if the box is something I ordered to give to my family, or
something someone else sent me as a gift. In the former case, I'll want
to wrap it and put it under the tree. In the latter, a lot of times my
wife will wrap it on behalf of the giver so it can still be a surprise
Christmas morning. The problem is telling them apart.

I guess I'm not the only one with this problem. A friend sent me a
message thanking me for a gift basket I'd sent him a couple of weeks
ago. He hadn't opened it until it was time to start wrapping all the
presents he'd ordered himself from Amazon. Hopefully the food was still
edible.

At first I was thinking that Amazon needs to figure out how to solve
that problem. If I were Amazon, I might just suggest gift wrapping
presents to others so that it is always safe to open the box, but gift
wrap starts to get expensive -- especially if you have several
less-expensive items.

Another solution is to address the packages in a way that differentiates
them. I've changed my wishlist address so that it includes "(Wishlist)"
after my name. My regular ordering address now has "(Self Order)" after
my name. Now maybe I just need to add "(A gift for you)" after the names
of my friends to tip them off.

I guess I'll see how it goes...
