Coming Up Gadget is a reminder tool for upcoming events for Windows
Vista or Windows 7. It retrieves events either from Microsoft Outlook or
a Google Calendar account (including Google Apps). Coming Up is intended
to remind you of things bigger than just your next meeting --
things like people's birthdays, anniversaries, holidays, etc. To do
this, it looks for calendar items marked as "all day event". The gadget
shows up to twenty events coming up in the next three weeks. It
automatically refreshes every 15 minutes. If you click on an event, it
will open the item from Outlook or Google where you can see the details.

Update version 0.9.1 (23 Aug 2008) - Gadget now pages through up to
twenty events for the next three weeks instead of just four.

Update version 0.9.2 (26 Feb 2009) - Fixed reading events for non-US
locales. Special thanks to John Upstone.

Update version 0.9.3 (08 Jun 2010) - Added support for Google Calendar
(enter your credentials in the settings).
