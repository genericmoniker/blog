I remember reading an
[article](http://www.asktog.com/TOI/toi06KeyboardVMouse1.html) by Bruce
Tognazzini (AKA “Tog”) many years ago about how extensive research at
Apple indicated that using the mouse is faster than using shortcut keys
on the keyboard. This always seemed wrong to me, but after using a Mac
somewhat regularly for the past few weeks, I think I’m beginning to
understand.

When doing shortcut keys on a Mac, you typically use the Command key,
which is right next to the spacebar.

The trouble I have is that I don’t know which finger to use to push the
Command key. No matter which finger you pick, you’re guaranteed to have
to move a hand off the keyboard home row. If I have to do something like
Command + Shift + F, it actually takes some cognitive effort to get
there. Contrast this with a Windows shortcut, which typically uses the
Control key. It’s in the corner of the keyboard (even on the Mac
keyboard above), which means it’s easy to put a pinky down there and
still stay anchored on the home row.

Maybe the lesson to be learned from the research is not “optimize for
the mouse” but rather “move the shortcut key”.
