Introduction
------------

Most people believe that the city of Lehi, Utah was named after Lehi, the first
prophet and patriarch of the Book of Mormon who fled Jerusalem with his family
prior to the city falling under siege to the Babylonians around the beginning
of the 6th century BC. Both the Wikipedia articles for "Lehi, Utah" [1](#note1)  
and "Lehi (Book of Mormon prophet)" [2](#note2) say this is the case
[3](#note3), and although the current official city web site doesn't mention
the origin of the name, previous versions of the site included a summary by
Lehi city historian Richard S. Van Wagoner saying of the name Lehi, "Like the
Book of Mormon patriarch of the same name, the colonizers of Lehi had been
uprooted on numerous occasions before finally settling in their promised land."
[4](#note4) It is possible, though, that the city's name has a different
provenance.

An Analogy
----------

Suppose there was a contemporary man named George Washington who made
outstanding contributions to education in his community throughout his
lifetime. Because of this, the local school board decided to name a new
elementary school after him. Imagine how difficult it could be to preserve the
origin of that school's name when there is such an obvious, though incorrect,
alternative origin. The origin of Lehi could be a similar situation.

The City of Lehi
----------------

According to History of Lehi Including a Biographical Section, by Hamilton
Gardner, Lehi was variously called Sulphur Springs, Dry Creek, and Evansville
when it was first being settled. David Evans, a Mormon bishop and community
leader (and hence "Evansville"), is credited with the petition to incorporate
the settlement into a city in 1852. Gardner's history says, "This petition was
granted, and the city incorporated under the name of Lehi, this Book of Mormon
appellation being suggested because the people had moved so frequently."
[5](#note5) The act of incorporation, after specifying the proposed geography,
simply says, "â€¦is hereby incorporated into a city, which shall be called the
'City of Lehi,' and the inhabitants thereof are hereby constituted a body
corporate and politic, by the name aforesaid." [6](#note6)

Despite the references to the first Book of Mormon prophet, with a couple of
not-so-large leaps, it can be shown that the city's namesake is only
tangentially from the prophet Lehi.

Leap 1 - Cities Named for Cities
--------------------------------

According to Wikipedia's list of cities and towns in Utah, there are five
cities with names from the Book of Mormon: [7](#note7)

* Bountiful
* Lehi
* Manti
* Moroni
* Nephi

The first of these named was Manti. According to the Utah state historical web
site, "Brigham Young named the site 'Manti' in the summer of 1850, at the
request of the local patriarch Isaac Morley. The name was derived from that
section of the 'Book of Mormon' called Alma." [8](#note8)

Although there is a Nephite soldier named Manti in the Book of Mormon, a much
more prominent usage is as a land and a city. [9](#note9) The precedent was
therefore established of naming cities in Utah after cities in the Book of
Mormon, rather than after people in the Book of Mormon. In fact, all of the
names above are mentioned as cities in the Book of Mormon, even if most of them
were originally named after people. [10](#note10)

David Evans might have found the name of Lehi particularly suited for his
community since the Book of Mormon city is described as being "in the north by
the borders of the seashore" [11](#note11) just as Lehi, Utah is on the north
end of Utah Lake, the second largest body of water in the state.

Leap 2 - City of Lehi's Namesake
--------------------------------

If Lehi, Utah was named after the Book of Mormon city of Lehi, who was the Book
of Mormon city named after?

According to the *Book of Mormon Onomasticon*, there are four people named Lehi
in the Book of Mormon. [12](#note12) The first is the prophet who fled
Jerusalem, while the last is the younger son of the prophet Helaman. The middle
two are associated with the Nephite military, and it seems likely that they are
actually the same person.

The first mention (referred to as LEHI2 in the Book of Mormon index and the
*Onomasticon*) is of the son of the Nephite chief captain, Zoram, who joined with
his father and brother to rescue some of their people who had been captured by
the enemy. [13](#note13)

The next mention (LEHI3) is seven years later as leader of part of the Nephite
army when Moroni was the chief captain. [14](#note14) This Lehi played a
dominant role in the Nephite war against the Lamanites, such that Moroni and
Lehi "were beloved by each other, and also beloved by all the people of Nephi."
[15](#note15) and the Lamanites "feared Lehi exceedingly". [16](#note16)

It is during this time of warfare that the Book of Mormon tells of the
establishment of several cities: [17](#note17)

> Thus Moroni, with his armies, which did increase daily because of the
> assurance of protection which his works did bring forth unto them, did seek
> to cut off the strength and the power of the Lamanites from off the lands of
> their possessions, that they should have no power upon the lands of their
> possession.
>
> And it came to pass that the Nephites began the foundation of a city, and
> they called the name of the city Moroni; and it was by the east sea; and it
> was on the south by the line of the possessions of the Lamanites.
>
> And they also began a foundation for a city between the city of Moroni and
> the city of Aaron, joining the borders of Aaron and Moroni; and they called
> the name of the city, or the land, Nephihah.
>
> And they also began in that same year to build many cities on the north, one
> in a particular manner which they called Lehi, which was in the north by the
> borders of the seashore.

Here we have mention of three new cities. The first, Moroni, after the chief
captain of the armies. The second, Nephihah, after the chief judge of the
Nephite government, and finally Lehi, after the contemporary military
commander.

Conclusion
----------

It is difficult to know David Evan's thinking as he proposed "Lehi" as the name
of his new city. But if he named his city after the Book of Mormon city, and
that Book of Mormon city was named as suggested here, then the City of Lehi is
ultimately named after a Nephite war hero from the first century BC.
