Hollywood memoirs aren't things I normally read. I like movies, but usually I prefer the
characters to the actors, so I'm fine being ignorant. *Waxing On: The Karate Kid and Me*
by Ralph Macchio ended up in my hands after helping a neighbor with a computer problem.
The problem was pretty trivial, but my neighbor was freaking out because of a looming
deadline. After the problem was fixed, he was telling me this crazy story about going to
a movie with an associate and Brandon Sanderson. My neighbor, having never heard of Mr.
Sanderson, didn't know that he's kind of a big deal. I mentioned meeting Brandon at
Comic Con in 2015, and a couple of other people, including Ralph Macchio, who signed a
photo for my son who had just earned his black belt in karate.

My neighbor said, "Oh, speaking of Ralph Macchio... here." He had a couple of
pre-release copies of "Waxing On" among the piles of books and papers in his home
office. This neighbor works for the Jimmy Kimmel show and had been sent the books to
help prepare for [Mr. Macchio's interview on the
show](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUXiTxl_jos) promoting the book. So my neighbor
gave me a copy as a thanks.

I saw *The Karate Kid* in 1984 right before starting my senior year in high school, and
it left a big enough impression that I wrote about seeing it in my journal, um, multiple
times. I may have even teared up a bit for the [chore payoff
scene](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LerwIYmNFXY). So sure, I wanted to read Ralph's
book.

In the first chapters of the book he tells how the movie came about, how he landed the
part of Daniel LaRusso, and how the other main actors were cast. Some fun facts:

- Actors in the running for the part of Daniel: Charlie Sheen, C. Thomas Howell, Robert
  Downey Jr. and Chuck Norris' son Kyle.
- In the original script, the character was Daniel Webber, but changed to an Italian
  name when Macchio got the part.
- Pat Morita (Mr. Miyagi in the movie) had played Arnold in *Happy Days*, and even
  though I had watched *Happy Days* a lot while growing up, I had never made the
  connection (remember, ignorant?).

On that last point, Ralph (and others) expressed initial dismay that they were
considering the goofy Arnold actor for a serious dramatic role. But opinions quickly
changed and Morita was later nominated for an Oscar for his portrayal of Mr. Miyagi.

Maybe the biggest challenge of playing such an iconic character is the inability for
people to see you as anyone *other* than the karate kid. Ralph talks about his fear of
being pigeon-holed to that role, and the struggle to find new opportunities after
completing his contract for three Karate Kid movies. Trying to distance himself from the
character even led to one of his biggest regrets: He turned down an offer to host the
Academy Awards with Pat Morita, missing out on probably a once-in-a-lifetime
opportunity.

The book deals with mistakes and struggles, but has an overall positive feeling,
especially in light of the recent success of Netflix's *Cobra Kai*, wherein Ralph gets
to reprise his role as an older Daniel LaRusso with kids of his own. Without that, this
book would be unlikely to exist. Even though I've watched *Cobra Kai* (still a few
episodes left to see in season 5), there are a bunch of things Ralph pointed out in the
book that I had missed. One of the most significant was that the LaRusso relative and
no-nonsense child psychology grad student who evaluates Daniel and Amanda's parenting
skills was played by Ralph Macchio's own daughter, Julia. Oh the irony!

One of the most poignant stories in the book for me was when a mother and teen-aged son
approached Ralph at the airport one time. Their family had often watched the movies
together and adapted lines into their conversations ("Always look eye Brian-san"). But
the father of the family had passed away, and the son was struggling. Ralph took the
time to talk to this at first reticent teen-aged boy and made a real and meaningful
connection with him.

Overall, I'm happy that I know how to toggle headers and footers in Microsoft
Word so that I was able to enjoy this book.
