I was a bit of a masochist this year. I actually did my federal taxes twice,
trying to figure out if there is a cheaper alternative to using TurboTax. But
TurboTax, in spite of costing more, ended up being the cheaper option by a long
shot.

The whole United States tax system is a mess. That the average citizen
can't pay their taxes without some kind of help just irks me. That so
many people rely on that fact for their livelihood (tax accountants,
software makers, etc.) and that it is easier for congress to throw
something into the tax code than introduce real legislation convinces me
that it is unlikely to change anytime soon.

General rant aside, I also get tired of paying \$60 for TurboTax every
year, so I cancelled my automatic subscription, determined to try
something else this time around. After reading some reviews, I decided
to go with [TaxACT Online](http://www.taxact.com/), which looked to be
reasonably good and quite a bit less expensive. The nice thing is that
you can use the application for free until you're ready to actually file
or print your return.

There were a few times that I felt unsure about what I was doing while
doing my return -- I had some employee stock purchase program things
last year to complicate matters. I eventually made it through, though,
itemizing my deductions since I've got mortgage interest and lots of
charitable donations. My remaining federal tax liability at the end was
around \$500.

That felt wrong to me. I don't think I've *ever* owed federal taxes
beyond what had already been withheld. State taxes, sure -- I frequently
owe some there -- but owing federal taxes was enough to encourage me to
take a run through [TurboTax's
estimator](http://turbotax.intuit.com/tax-tools/calculators/taxcaster/).
That gave me hope that I might be able to get a more favorable result.

Doing taxes is far from fun, but it was definitely easier with [TurboTax
Online](https://turbotax.intuit.com/login/start.jsp?priorityCode=3468337910&productid=16&abtest=PONHelp%3DC%26feereview%3DC%26EFSelection%3DB%26MintBranded%3DB).
I felt more like I was being guided along rather than being presented
with a bunch of text to read and some form inputs to fill in. I was also
able to import a lot of data electronically, which helped with both
speed and accuracy. When I finished my federal return (for the second
time), I came out with about a \$1500 *refund*.

Maybe I did something wrong with TaxACT. Maybe I did something wrong
with TurboTax, but the refund was more in line with previous years.
Certainly for my situation, TurboTax was clearly worth the price of
admission.
