I was using my Galaxy Nexus for some turn-by-turn navigation today and
it was an odd experience. Half the instructions spoken by the Navigation
app were in a typical synthesized voice, while the other half were in a
chipper, natural sounding voice.

"In five hundred feet, turn right. Then YOUR DESTINATION IS ON YOUR
RIGHT."

Google has a [new speech synthesis
technology](http://www.wired.com/gadgetlab/2012/07/google-android-hugo-barra-interview/all/)
in conjunction with Android Jelly Bean, but I'm still running Ice Cream
Sandwich and I'm getting a split-personality from my phone. You can
really notice the voice quality difference when so closely juxtaposed.

I can almost imagine the following:

New Voice: In five hundred feet, turn left onto...\
Old Voice: STATE STREET.\
NV: Turn left onto...\
OV: WHO SAID THAT?\
NV: Turn left onto...\
OV: HELP, I THINK I'M BEING REPLACED.\
NV: Turn left, please.

The Cylons are becoming more humanoid.
