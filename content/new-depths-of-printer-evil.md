I frequently say, only half-jokingly, that printers are evil. Actually I
love my HP LaserJet 1320, but my Canon Pixma 620 is just plain E-V-I-L.

OK, pretty much any inkjet printer is devil-spawn, with the well-cited
fact that printer ink is the most expensive liquid on the planet. Canon
has taken the Pixma to a new level, though, because while it is a
combination printer/scanner/fax, you can't do *anything* useful if
you're out of ink. Notably, in spite of the fact that no bits need
converting to atoms when *scanning* an image to your PC, you just can't
do it if you're out of ink. All you get is a message on the display
stating, "The following ink has run out. Replace the ink tank."

Yeah, the printer/scanner is pretty good when you're willing to open a
vein to fill the ink, but disabling non-ink functions by fiat is just
infuriating.
