About Work Plan Editor
----------------------

Work Plan Editor is a tool to help you convert task estimates into a
working schedule that will constantly update itself as you progress
through your tasks. You create a list of tasks, estimate the effort to
complete those tasks (in "ideal" time), add time off that you plan to
take, and Work Plan Editor calculates the actual dates when tasks should
be complete. If you finish a task early, your entire schedule moves up.
If you complete a task late, the schedule is likewise adjusted back. You
can keep a baseline in order to know how your current plan compares to
your original plan.

Work Plan Editor is more focused than an Excel spreadsheet, but simpler than
Microsoft Project. You can read more about the motivation behind it in
[this blog article]({static}/work-plan-editor-release.md).

### Known Issues

-   Undo/Redo is unreliable. If you do something really bad that needs
    to be undone, consider closing the plan without saving it to revert
    to your previous state.
-   You can't edit your time off entries. The workaround currently is to
    delete and re-add any entries that need to be modified.

If you discover a problem, use the **Help** &gt; **Send Comments or
