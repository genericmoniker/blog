It's become fairly clear that HP is not webOS' savior. It's also
unlikely that webOS can come back from the dead for the second time. But
it makes me sad, since webOS and its devices hit a sweet spot that no
one managed to exploit.

The currently winning smartphone platforms are the gated and guarded
community of iOS, and the wild-west of Android. Palm/HP had the vertical
integration of Apple with the openness of Google. Maybe in today's
polarized society, the middle has no appeal. But don't think that when I
say "middle" I mean not as good as either extreme -- it's more like the
best of both worlds.

Here are some of my favorite features of webOS:

1.  Fantastic muti-tasking that no one else has yet matched.
2.  A UI that is is richer than iOS and more beautiful than Android.
3.  Over-the-air activation/updates/etc. Attaching it to a PC is
    never required.
4.  Unobtrusive notifications that can be ignored without being lost.
5.  Merging all of your contacts/calendars from wherever they happen
    to live.
6.  Acceptance that Flash is still a significant web technology.
7.  No jailbreaking required - but rather a completely sanctioned
    developer mode that gives you root access to the device.
8.  HTML 5 application development as a first class citizen.
9.  C++ application development for gaming, etc.
10. A cloud-based IDE allowing app development in a browser.
11. It is Linux, so skills are transferable.
12. Inductive charging, so you don't have to plug in cords -- just drop
    it on the charger (OK, technically a hardware feature rather than
    webOS per se, but still awesome).

I have applications that I wrote myself or with co-workers in both the
HP App Catalog and the Apple App Store. I definitely prefer coding in
JavaScript as opposed to Objective-C, but the thing that makes my blood
boil in comparing the experience is Apple's provisioning profile system.
It's as if Apple said, "Please poke yourself in the eye at regular
intervals so that we can be sure you've paid us your developer program
fees." Having developed and submitted for webOS, it becomes obvious how
pointless the Apple system is. I wouldn't go to the trouble for a
personal project -- but what does Apple care about that?

I haven't developed for Android, but I like Java, so it could be a good
experience. But the Android ecosystem [seems like total
chaos](http://news.cnet.com/8301-31322_3-20120623-256/dear-android-this-is-your-last-chance/?tag=rtcol).

I did do some preliminary investigation into developing a video-centric
application for Android, but got stuck when trying to figure out what
video decoder support exists for the platform. Sure, there's something
that says H.264 is supported, but at what level and profile? Those are
kind of critical to know, but the information just isn't available. I
guess Google just left it up to the device manufacturers to do what they
wanted, which means trying to figure it out for every device. Compare
that to the [webOS information on video
formats](https://developer.palm.com/content/api/reference/services/video.html#supported-video-formats).

So I find myself in an unfortunate situation, hanging on to an aging
phone and not sure what I'd do if I accidentally dropped it on the
sidewalk tomorrow. Maybe, like I did the last time Palm imploded (with
Palm OS), I'd have to give Windows a try, and hope that it isn't the
soul-less experience it was last time.
