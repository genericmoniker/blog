My PC is sad. I know this because of the frowny face. Unfortunately, I
know not much more, because my PC won't boot, and Microsoft decided to
provide as little information about the error as possible on their new
BSOD screen.

Hmm... scary (but potentially useful) hexidecimal-laden error messages
or cute emoticon?

Thanks for that.
