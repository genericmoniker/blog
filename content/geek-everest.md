Some people apparently like the idea of grueling trek up ice and rock in
an environment so hostile to life that the way is [strewn with the
corpses](http://adventure.howstuffworks.com/dead-everest.htm) of those
who have tried to make it and failed.

C++ appears to be enjoying some renewed interest lately. Some of that is
due to the [recent C++ 11 update of the
language](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B0x). I also get a sense of
a backlash against the last decade of managed languages, citing C++'s
power and performance. But after living in that managed world, I
personally wouldn't be disappointed if never wrote another line C++.
