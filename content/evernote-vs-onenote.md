I've used both [Evernote](http://www.evernote.com/) and [Microsoft
OneNote](http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/onenote/) for several years.
While there are lots of extensive comparisons of the applications
around, I think the difference between them comes down to just a few
broad issues.

Evernote has these things going for it:

1.  Ubiquity
2.  Price (free)

OneNote's list is shorter:

1.  It's a truly excellent Windows application

The folks at Evernote can't quite seem to get their act together. I
think the Windows application has been through at least two complete
rewrites since I've been using it, each time with the promise that
*this* version will finally be the solid platform on which fantastic new
features will be added. But the editing abilities still compare
unfavorably to 1990's-era HTML editors.

I can expect, though, that I'll be able to find an Evernote client for
pretty much any platform I want, with data synchronized between all of
them because of Evernote's cloud focus. Not all of the clients are
created equal -- Evernote for the iPad simply refuses to edit notes with
"rich" formatting -- but they aren't bad.

OneNote's anchor to Desktop Windows has been its biggest downfall. The
cloud-stored notebooks of OneNote 2010 are a great advancement, but
Microsoft needs clients for other platforms -- and *good* clients at
that.Â Even when I had a Windows Mobile phone a few years ago, the
OneNote client there was pathetic. I regularly run Evernote clients on
Windows, Mac, iOS (iPad) and webOS, and until I can do the same with
OneNote, it's hard to imagine it becoming my primary exocortex. That
Microsoft has released an [iPhone
client](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/microsoft-onenote/id410395246?mt=8)
is promising. Hopefully they'll continue to add other platforms.

Using OneNote on Windows is a delight. Formatting works as expected
instead of suddenly flaking out like it does in Evernote. Tables are
easy to work with and look good. Images can be resized in-line. Screen
clips go into the note I'm editing instead of a separate note, which is
the behavior I want 95% of the time.

That Evernote is free is nice, but I've got 80 bucks sitting right here
for OneNote if it can make that final jump to universal access.
