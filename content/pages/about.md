Welcome to esmithy.net. A "smithy" is the workplace of a smith, so "esmithy" is
this particular smith's electronic workplace.

![Eric Smith Portrait]({filename}/site/eric-med.png)

I'm Eric Smith. I'm a software engineer, currently working for
[StorageCraft](http://www.storagecraft.com/). I graduated from
[BYU](http://byu.edu) with a degree in computer science.

I write here in hopes that my thoughts will be useful to someone -- including
my future self who, strangely, tends to forget things.

**Technical Details**

esmithy.net was a static web site before such things were cool, using XSLT and
an Ant script. For several years I switched over to use
[WordPress](http://wordpress.org) to make posting a simpler process. But blogs
are every programmer's place to fiddle with technologies, so I'm back to static
using [Pelican](https://blog.getpelican.com/).
