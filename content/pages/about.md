![Smithy]({static}/site/smithy-nauvoo.jpg)

**Welcome, imaginary reader, to esmithy.net!**

A site you've miraculously found without any SEO whatsoever.

A "smithy" is the workplace of a smith, so "esmithy" is
the electronic parallel, where bits of code, ideas, thoughts and opinions are
hammered out. The metaphors pretty much end there, thankfully.


**Technical Details**

esmithy.net was a static web site before such things were cool, using XSLT and
an Ant script. For several years it switched over to use
[WordPress](http://wordpress.org) to make posting a simpler process. But blogs
are every programmer's place to fiddle with technologies, so it is back to
static using [Pelican](https://blog.getpelican.com/).
