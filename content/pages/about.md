![Eric Smith Portrait]({filename}/images/eric-med.png)

Hi, I'm Eric Smith. I'm a software developer, currently working for
[StorageCraft](http://www.storagecraft.com/). I graduated from
[BYU](http://byu.edu) with a degree in computer science in 1993, and have been
working in the software industry since 1992.

Professionally, I've worked in C, C++, C\#, Java, JavaScript, Python and
probably other languages I can't recall at the moment. I've spent a lot
of time previously on information retrieval and electronic publishing
applications at Folio Corporation and NextPage, Inc., and video security
at Logitech.

This blog is to communicate my thoughts in hopes that they'll be useful to
someone -- including my future self who, strangely, tends to forget things.

esmithy.net was a static web site before such things were cool, using XSLT and
an Ant script. For several years I switched over to use
[WordPress](http://wordpress.org) to make posting a simpler process. But blogs
are every programmer's place to fiddle with technologies, so I'm back to static
using [Pelican](https://blog.getpelican.com/).

A "smithy" is the workplace of a smith, so "esmithy" is this particular
smith's electronic workplace.
