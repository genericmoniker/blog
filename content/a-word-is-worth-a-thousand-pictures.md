I found this sticker inside one of a pair of new shoes:

![First Picture]({filename}/images/shoe-1.jpg)

I didn't have any idea what this was saying. My wife suggested it meant
that I ought to watch out for diamonds... and maybe nets.

I found this sticker in the other shoe. I think it means the same thing:

![Second Picture]({filename}/images/shoe-2.jpg)
