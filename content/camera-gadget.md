The Alert Camera Gadget lets you keep an eye on your Logitech Alert
cameras by rotating through snapshots (still images) from all the
cameras associated with your account. This gadget is not provided by or
supported by Logitech in any way.

**0.8.0** (26 Sep 2012)

-   Fixed a couple of bugs in the previous version related to
    alternate servers.

**0.7.0** (25 Sep 2012)

    setting that many people won't care about.

-   The gadget periodically refreshes the list of cameras from online.
-   You can list camera names (in settings) that you don't want to be
    displayed by the gadget.

-   Clicking on a snapshot takes you to alert.logitech.com.

Troubleshooting
---------------

If you get an "unspecified error" message when trying to install, you
might need to "unblock" the .gadget file. Right click on the downloaded
file and choose "Properties", and there'll be a place near the bottom of
the dialog to unblock it.

If the gadget isn't working, you can run a little program called
[DebugView](http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb896647)
from Microsoft that will allow you to see the gadget's log messages. If
you find a bug, please
[email](mailto:support@esmithy.net&subject=Alert%20Camera%20Gadget) your
logs to me to have a look.
