I use Office 365 with the web version of Outlook at work. At some point, I'll
notice that the browser tab has changed appearance, and click on it to find
that I've been logged out. No worries, there's a prompt right there for my
password to renew my session. Soon I'll be able to again get the emails saying
the corporate Spam filter has blocked all of the messages coming from Sentry,
while letting through essential ads for toenail clippers.

After entering my password, I'm rewarded with this:

![Validation Error]({static}/images/login-again.png)

Now I need to re-enter the password that I *just* entered, apparently because I
didn't notice that I had been logged out quickly enough and the authorization
flow has expired. Thanks for that.
