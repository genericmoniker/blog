![Logitech vs. Apple mouse]({filename}/images/mice.jpg "Good vs. Evil")

I finally had to throw the shiny white excuse for a mouse into the
drawer and pull out a trusty VX Nano. The Apple mouse suffers from the
*form over function* malady: it is apparently too damaging to the
aesthetic to actually have separate left and right buttons. Instead the
mouse intuits which you want by how far to the left or right you press
your fingers. Unfortunately, it didn't work too well and I kept getting
left-clicks when I wanted right. That, and the fact that at the highest
sensitivity I still needed way too much desk space to maneuver across
the screen led to its replacement.
