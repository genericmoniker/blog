The "story" in agile development's "user story" is not a narrative in
the traditional sense of the word. Many are short on verbs, which is a
big hint that something non-narrative is going on. "User story" is
shorthand for a set of concepts and principles. The danger with taking a
simple word like "story" and assigning it a new meaning is that novices,
and occasionally even experts, confuse the jargon with the traditional
definition.

An example of an expert forgetting the jargon of "user story" is in a
small section of Mike Cohn's otherwise great book [*User Stories
Applied*](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3856.User_Stories_Applied?ac=1).
Here, the author is talking about the benefits of user
stories over other ways of specifying requirements:

> Additionally, a study in the late 1970s found that people are better
> able to remember events if they are organized into stories (Bower,
> Black and Turner 1979). Even better, study participants had better
> recall of both stated actions as well as inferred actions. That is,
> not only do stories facilitate recall of stated actions, they
> facilitate recall of the unstated actions. The stories we write can be
> more terse than traditional requirement specifications or even use
> cases, and because they are written and discussed as stories, recall
> will be greater. 

While I haven't read the study mentioned (maybe [this is the
abstract](http://psycnet.apa.org/?fa=main.doiLanding&fuseaction=showUIDAbstract&uid=1979-27802-001)?)
I doubt they were studying agile "user stories" back in 1979. From what
I've been able to gather from secondary sources, they were studying how
stories (in the narrative sense) have a more abstract representation
than the actual words that are said, and that memory relies more on that
abstract representation such that it's hard to remember if something was
explicitly said in the story or just implied.

In short, applying the results of this study to user stories is pretty
bogus.
