Hmm... this zip code looks pretty good to me.

This was on the Discount Tire mobile site. It's awesome that you can
schedule a service appointment on the web using your mobile phone. It's
not so awesome that the form validation doesn't compensate for the
trailing space that my phone's keyboard automatically added. "Normal"
people would give up when the site refused to accept such an obviously
correct entry.
