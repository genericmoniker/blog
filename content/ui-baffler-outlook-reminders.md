Why is it that in the Outlook reminders dialog, the "Dismiss All" button is
disabled if there are no reminder items selected?

Well clearly it is because that button is supposed to dismiss all of the
*selected* reminders, right?

No, because if there is *any* selected reminder, clicking "Dismiss All" will
dismiss *all* of the reminders.

I'm really curious as to how the developers arrived at that interaction.
