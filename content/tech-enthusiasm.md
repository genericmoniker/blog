I've read some things recently about choosing the right tool for the job, from a
technology and programming language perspective. Most recently it was [a post by
Jeremy Bowers](https://jerf.org/iri/post/2024/not_about_python/).

In it, he pokes at Python's weaknesses, but he isn't *really* writing about
Python (as he says many times). Instead he's saying that talking about
weaknesses is often perceived as an attack that must be defended against by
those who are "fans" of technologies when technology choices are being made.

Yes, I agree. There are always trade-offs and a project is going to have a
greater chance of success if rational technology choices are made. And being a
"fan", especially in the "fanatic" sense isn't an attitude conducive to rational
choice. But if I take the liberty of softening "fan" to be more like
"enthusiast", I want to say:

Show me an engineer who isn't a fan of any technologies and I'll show you an
engineer who isn't an expert in any.

It is hard to imagine an engineer would read books, listen to podcasts, read and
write blog posts, do side projects, and convince her boss to send her to
conferences without her having some enthusiasm for the subject matter. And being
an expert with a technology can make it the right choice in more situations.

I guess I feel like it is OK to be a fan of technologies, so long as the
relationship isn't exclusive. Being a fan of Python isn't so great if its the
only language you've used. Being a fan of React isn't so great if you've never
built a traditional server-side HTML web application. Diversify your knowledge
with technologies that work well in different situations, but don't feel bad if
you get excited about some more than others.
