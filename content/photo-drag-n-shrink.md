Photo Drag 'n Shrink is a simple utility for resizing images. This is
handy if you've got a lot of pictures that you want to resize for faster
uploading or copying to a device where small size is more important than
resolution -- like a digital photo frame or mobile device.

The application watches a folder that you specify for image files that
get copied there and automatically resizes them according to the
settings you provide. It supports the following image types:

-   BMP
-   JPEG
-   GIF
-   PNG
-   TIFF

**Tip**: If you accidentally *move* an original file into the directory
it will be resized, but a copy of the full-size original will be stored
in the Recycle Bin so that you can restore it.
